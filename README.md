# Customer-Segmentation-Using-K-Means-Clustering
Customer Segmentation, which utilizes the K-Means Clustering algorithm to classify customers into distinct groups based on their behavior and attributes. This segmentation helps businesses understand their customers better, personalize marketing strategies, and improve overall customer satisfaction.

# Project Overview
Customer segmentation is a critical technique for businesses to identify patterns in customer data. By grouping customers based on similarities, companies can target each segment more effectively and make data-driven decisions.
In this project, we apply K-Means Clustering, a powerful unsupervised machine learning algorithm, to segment customers using their demographic and behavioral data.
